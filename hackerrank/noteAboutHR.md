# A note about these HackerRank problems

If you look at the other folders in this repository, you'll notice that there are links to the various problems in the files themselves (a comment at the bottom usually). I haven't included them for HackerRank's problems as they come from different things on HackerRank, and I don't know if the links will work without an account. Of course, the same might be said of LeetCode (and possibly Project Euler), but I don't know.

Also, if you look at these problems on HackerRank in JavaScript, then you'll notice a whole bunch of other code in the area where you type in your code. I took this out because it made the files quite long and hard to find my actual work. However, if you looked at it on HackerRank, I think a lot of it is there to "guide" the compiler on how to function properly (the use of a "main" function reminds me of Java/C and their "descendants").
