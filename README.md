# coding-challenges
Where I keep solutions to coding challenges that I've completed.

# Why do this?
This is meant to be a reference for myself whenever I complete coding problems. 

(Plus, for you up-and-coming developers, it's a "cheeky" way to keep your activity squares green. Yes, in some ways, it's very superfluous, but some people believe that green squares are important when hiring).
 
 # DISCLAIMER
 PLEASE do not copy these and use them for the actual problems on these sites. Not only is that essentially plagiarism, but you're actually doing yourself a MAJOR disservice in doing so.
 
 Yes, odds are that these will get you a "solution accepted" on LeetCode, but what's the point of that if you have no idea *how* it works? I once had "cheating" in software described to me as "copying something without knowing how it works", and it's very true - plus, it goes hand in hand with the idea of "cheaters never prosper".
 
 If you're trying to find a job by pointing to your large quantity of "solved LeetCode problems", then you'd better be ready to back that up in an interview. If you can't, don't expect to get hired anytime soon...
